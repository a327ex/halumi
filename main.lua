  halumi — an Anchor 3 game.

  Scaffolded by `anchor new`. Read Anchor/engine/docs/SURFACE.md first: how a
  game is run, driven, recorded and reloaded.

  THIS FILE HOLDS DEFINITIONS ONLY, so saving it re-runs them in the live
  globals — functions rebind, constants go live, and the state boot.lua made
  survives. One-time work (layers, fonts, binds, state) belongs in boot.lua,
  which the init table names below and which never reloads.

  Run it with run.bat (the owner's). Drive it with:
    anchor drive start .
    anchor drive eval  . 'engine_step(60) return box_x'
    anchor drive stop  .
