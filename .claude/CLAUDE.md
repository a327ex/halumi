Guidelines for Claude Code instances working in this project.

An Anchor 3 game, scaffolded by `anchor new`.

## Read first

`Anchor/engine/docs/SURFACE.md` — how a game is run, driven, recorded and
reloaded, on one page. Then `docs/FRAMEWORK_API_QUICK.md` and
`docs/ENGINE_API_QUICK.md` for signatures, and
`reference_anchor_gotchas` territory before any draw or input code. Look
functions up; never guess a signature.

## Running it

Never run the game yourself — `run.bat` and feel are the owner's. Run it as
an agent instance instead (hidden window, externally paced, recorded), from
this folder:

    anchor drive start .
    anchor drive eval  . 'engine_step(60) return box_x'
    anchor drive stop  .

Static check before every handover:

    anchor check .

## Layout

- `main.lua` — definitions only (it reloads on save); the init table names
  `boot.lua` and the last line requires it
- `boot.lua` — one-time work: layers, fonts, binds, state (never reloads)
- `anchor/` — THIS GAME'S OWN copy of the framework. Port framework changes
  in per file with `anchor framework status|diff|upgrade`; never overwrite it
  wholesale
- `assets/` — images, fonts, sounds

Every turn spent here is snapshotted onto the `ai/journal` branch by the Stop
hook and carded in the session log; the branch is pushed at `anchor continue`.
